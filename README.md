# Java-Music-Player
Welcome! In this class java project, I created a music player simulator in java. This music player takes an initial database of songs and 
allows new song add-ins, playlist creations, and multiple playback modes (i.e. in-order, random, recommended, most frequently listened). The song data was stored using tree maps and hash tables. The recommended songs were chosen using the Jaccard Similarity Score and utilizing Priority Queues to create the recommendation system and algorithm. The toughest challenge was making sure each class and playlist component integrates well with each other, as they build off of each other.
